<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You have been invited to take part in a research study named Idea Generation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The research is being conducted by Richard W. Hass, PhD.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The study in which you will be participating is part of research intended to illuminate how people generate multiple ideas using memory. By conducting this study, the researcher hopes to add to the growing knowledge on creative thinking and idea generation. The researcher is a faculty member in Thomas Jefferson University’s Psychology program.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you agree to take part in this research, you will be asked to generate ideas to a number of prompts. The prompts will appear on the screen as English words. You will be given 3 minutes to think of responses for each of 10 prompts. There will be a chance for you to take breaks during the task, and between each break, there will be some downtime between the different prompts (approximately 5s). The tasks are not designed to be very difficult, nor will they expose you to any threatening, unpleasant, or otherwise aversive information. Rather, the experiment is designed to answer questions about human memory and creativity, which will have broad benefits to society.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Your participation in this research is confidential. At the end of the experiment, you will be asked only to supply your age, gender, and ethnicity, along with a rating of how engaging the task was for you. Only the person in charge will have access to your identity and to information that can be associated with your identity. In the event of publication of this research, no personally identifying information will be disclosed. To make sure your participation is confidential we will keep all identifying information separate from our data for analysis. It is only used to provide payment for your HIT.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">  Your participation is voluntary. You are free to stop participating in the research at any time, or decline to participate further in the research without penalty.</span></p>
