# FAN-exp
Variation of the idea Idea Generation with updated code and for the experiments reported in Beaty, Kenett, Hass, & Schacter (2019).

Note: to duplicate this experiment, one needs a PsiTurk account and access to that server. This may not be possible in some instances, however, the JavaScript files in the "Static" folder give a good indication of how to make an experiment using any kind of .js library. Try and see if you can make it work! Consult the PsiTurk git page for more information.
